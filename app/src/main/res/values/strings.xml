Coming!
Hang on a second.

\n- Can you believe this is happening?
\n- I can\'t. I\'ll pick you up.

Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.

\n- Ow! That\'s me!
\n- Wave to us! We\'ll be in row 118,000.
\n- Bye!
\nBarry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
\n- Hey, Adam.
\n- Hey, Barry.
\n- Is that fuzz gel?
\n- A little. Special day, graduation.</string>
