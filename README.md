How to run the app:
    To run the app there are two methods that can be used. The first is to download Android Studio and build the app through that software. Android Studio will let users build applications onto virtual devices or Android smart phones if connected. If this method is pursued, users will need to clone this GitHub repository onto their computer and open the project in Android Studio then "Run" the app

    The other method to run the app is download the version on the app store under the name Quest Recycles created by developer domain Krsikapa.Nicholas.

    Both methods will give users a fully working version of the app and see what was created.

How to use App:

    Entire app is organized through a Drawer navigation meaning at any point you may swipe from the left to the center of the screen to access the guide to switch screens. You can also access this guide by pressing the hamburger icon at the top left of all screens.

Search Function:
    At the top-right corner of all screens there is a magnifying glass icon. When pressed it will bring users to a search bar where they can enter the name of any item they wish to learn how to dispose of. As the name is typed in, suggestions from the database will appear below. If they click on the suggestion, a pop-up window will appear displaying the item name and the bin it should be put in

Home Screen:
    The home screen is the first option that users see when they open the app. On it will be a list of all upcoming collection dates for the users. Each collection date has buttons telling users what bins are to be collected that specific day and if pressed it will redirect users to the guide page showing them information on that specific bin. The upcoming collection day remains stationary at the top of the screen but users can scroll through the other dates to look ahead.

Queen's Campus:
    This page is intended for users looking for information on Queen's University specific items. It first displays a list of vendors on Queen's Campus as well as the building they are located in below. If a vendor is clicked a pop-up window appears showing users common items found at that vendor as well as the proper bin to dispose of it.
