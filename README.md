How to use App:
Navigation:
    Entire app is organized through a Drawer navigation meaning at any point you may swipe from the left to the center of the screen to access the guide to switch screens. You can also access this guide by pressing the hamburger icon at the top left of all screens.

Search Function:
    At the top-right corner of all screens there is a magnifying glass icon. When pressed it will bring users to a search bar where they can enter the name of any item they wish to learn how to dispose of. As the name is typed in, suggestions from the database will appear below. If they click on the suggestion, a pop-up window will appear displaying the item name and the bin it should be put in

Home Screen:
    The home screen is the first option that users see when they open the app. On it will be a list of all upcoming collection dates for the users. Each collection date has buttons telling users what bins are to be collected that specific day and if pressed it will redirect users to the guide page showing them information on that specific bin. The upcoming collection day remains stationary at the top of the screen but users can scroll through the other dates to look ahead.

Queen's Campus:
    This page is intended for users looking for information on Queen's University specific items. It first displays a list of vendors on Queen's Campus as well as the building they are located in below. If a vendor is clicked a pop-up window appears showing users common items found at that vendor as well as the proper bin to dispose of it.

Guide:
    The guide page is split into a bottom navigation which separates the different type of bins collected in Kingston or categories of waste (Blue bin, Green bin , Grey bin, Garbage, other items). Users can switch between each bins page by clicking each icon at the bottom of the page. On each page are helpful tips and information regarding the bin.

    This page is simply to provide users with a brief summary on who QUEST is and their goals as an organization.

    The resources page contains helpful organizations or resources for users both within Kingston and in Ontario regarding proper waste disposal and environmental awareness. Users can scroll down throughout the page to look at the different resourcems provided.

Settings:
    In this page users can set their collection region. At the top of the page is a list of days of the week from Monday to Friday. By default the collection list is set to Monday.
